# crews-and-robots-mozilla
Replaces all instances of "manned" with "crewed" and "unmanned" with "robotic", as inspired by [Robert A. McNees](http://jacobi.luc.edu/extensions.html).  Derived from the work of Steven Frank's [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) Chrome extension and Chris Wright's [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla) Firefox extension.
